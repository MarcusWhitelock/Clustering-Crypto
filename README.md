### Background

You are a Senior Manager at the Advisory Services team on a [Big Four firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms). One of your most important clients, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers, however, they are lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies. They ask you to help them make sense of it all by generating a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification.  


Steps:

Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

Reduce data dimension using the `PCA` algorithm from `sklearn`.

Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the `KMeans` algorithm from `sklearn`.

Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

Deploy your notebook to Amazon SageMaker.
